# Codex TSO-DSO NMPC

This repository will host a reproducible research workflow for transmissionâ€“distribution (TSO-DSO) co-ordination via distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The current milestone (M0) provides a minimal, testable scaffold with tooling configured through `uv`.

- Project package lives under `src/app/` and exposes a placeholder CLI via `uv run codex-nmpc`.
- Quality gates run with `uv format`, `uv run ruff check`, and `uv run pytest -q`.
- Tests cover the CLI entrypoint, M1 profile loader (gaps, resampling, alignment), and M3 partition power-flow checks.
- M1 adds a synthetic 24-hour, 5-minute profile dataset with loaders, tests, and a plotting script.
- M2 introduces IEEE-33 distribution sensitivities with automated validation and error distribution artifacts under `artifacts/m2/`.
- M3 partitions the IEEE-33 feeder into north/east/south DSOs, exposes boundary interfaces, and validates partition vs. full-network power flows with outputs in `artifacts/m3/`.
- M4 provides a 4-bus TSO overlay with DC power-flow checks, coupling the DSO partitions via aggregated injections and exporting validation artefacts under `artifacts/m4/`.
- M5 implements a distributed NMPC surrogate, delivering convergence histories and final control actions across DSO partitions with artefacts in `artifacts/m5/`.
- M6 adds rolling-horizon robustness experiments with stochastic disturbances and drift, logging residual/objective trajectories to `artifacts/m6/`.
- M7 assembles an end-to-end reproduction pipeline with aggregated metrics (see `artifacts/m7/`).

For quick hands-on instructions and future reproduction steps, see `README-quickstart.md`.
